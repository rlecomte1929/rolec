# ReloPass MVP

**Your guided relocation journey from Oslo, Norway to Singapore**

ReloPass is a multi-agent guided intake system that helps families relocate smoothly. This MVP is specifically designed for a family of four moving from Oslo to Singapore, collecting the minimum viable data needed to:

1. Start/prepare the immigration journey (informational readiness rating)
2. Request quotes from moving companies
3. Apply for temporary apartments
4. Shortlist schools for children

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)

  - **Agent C**: Immigration Readiness Rater (informational only)
  - **Agent D**: Recommendation Engine (housing, schools, movers)

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Component Library**: Antigravity (custom modern UI components)

## ✅ Testing

### Run All Tests
```bash
./run_all_tests.sh
```

This runs both backend (26 tests) and frontend (18 tests) with coverage reporting.

**Test Results**:
- ✅ 44/44 tests passing
- ✅ 94% backend code coverage
- ✅ Integration tests for complete user journey

See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for detailed test documentation.

### Quick Test Commands

**Backend only**:
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

**Frontend only**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm test -- --run
```

## 🎨 Design Principles

1. **Low friction**: Ask only what's necessary
2. **Progressive disclosure**: One question at a time
3. **Transparent**: Always explain why we ask
4. **Flexible**: Support "unknown" answers
5. **Clear outcomes**: Status dashboard, not form pile

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Scope Limitations
- **No payments** - MVP doesn't handle transactions
- **No external integrations** - Google login is mocked
- **Informational only** - Not legal advice (disclaimer shown)
- **Single use case** - Oslo → Singapore, family of four only
- **Mock data** - Recommendations use seeded datasets

### Data Model
The system tracks:
- **Household**: Family size, spouse, 2 children
- **Primary Applicant**: Passport, employer (Norwegian Investment), assignment
- **Move Plan**: Housing, schooling, moving preferences
- **Compliance**: Document checklist

---

## 🧪 Testing the Flow

1. **Login** with `test@example.com`
2. **Answer core questions**:
   - Arrival date
   - Assignment start date
   - Personal details (names, nationalities)
   - Housing preferences (budget, areas, bedrooms)
   - School preferences (curriculum, budget)
   - Moving details (inventory size)
   - Document availability
3. **View Dashboard** to see:
   - Readiness score
   - Recommendations
   - Timeline with tasks
   - Next actions

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Mock authentication (production would use OAuth2)
- No password storage
- Token-based session management
- CORS enabled for local development
